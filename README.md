This is code to put a simple test, with a few questions, and simple yes/no count scoring, into a shortcode in WordPress, so it can be inserted as a button.

Questions and answers are in Swedish, but it should be simple to translate. Style is controlled entirely by CSS.

The repo also contains 

* an index.html file that can be used while testing/developing. *DO NOT INSTALL THIS* into WP. After cloning this repo, navigate to file:///your-install-path/index.html. Make sure you do a hard refresh when you've changed the javascript or the style.
* a shell script to start a WP podman container
